# GameVerse 

Welcome to GameVerse! This project showcases a web application with a demo version and a full version using Node.js and MongoDB.(See Screenshots below)

## Demo

To quickly preview the website, you can use the live server for a basic demo. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. **Install Live Server:**

    If you don't have Live Server installed, you can add it as a VSCode extension or install it globally via npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g live-server
    ```

4. **Run Live Server:**

    ```bash
    live-server
    ```

   This will open a browser window with the demo version of the website.

## Full Version

For the full version of the website that includes backend functionality with Node.js and MongoDB, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set Up MongoDB:**

    Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine. If you donâ€™t have MongoDB installed, you can follow the instructions on the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

5. **Create a `.env` File:**

    In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB connection string:

    ```plaintext
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
    ```

6. **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the Node.js server and connect to MongoDB.

7. **Access the Application:**

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the full version of the website.
